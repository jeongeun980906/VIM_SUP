Now, what if one of the friends becomes very excited and energetic upon meeting the other friend?

Two individuals stand facing each other, one person extends his/her hand for a handshake, and the other person warmly accepts and shakes the hand gently.

The first person extends his/her hand for a handshake, but the second person, instead of shaking hands, jumps towards the first person and wraps them into a big hug, lifting them slightly off the ground.
